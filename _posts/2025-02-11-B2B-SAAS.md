# B2B - Brain to Brain

I have always been interested in the functioning and organization of brain. Some people have been saying the age of B2B SAAS is over, it's the age of Agent as a service. But we are at the dawn of an era where we are going to experince a revolutionary shift in the way we consume and transmit information. To back this stupendous claim let me attach some research papers I am going to read this week.

Will write detailed blog posts about each later. 

1. [Brain to QWERTY](https://scontent.fblr20-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/475464888_600710912891423_9108680259802499048_n.pdf?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=skBEbLcNeccQ7kNvgHSBWI4&_nc_oc=AdjjniBNjgSDOk84J1BpZ9jWmZk_qn1-Q2s_wNDPIMrvmrAMOhb7wDNmEZqepN2xFw39kVOZz92frKilqLd6hgNR&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fblr20-2.fna&_nc_gid=Ak54fzGaK9nq7R0Ow-rHKNN&oh=00_AYB-lBgocPpK0sSyAgpBWcvDWlFOIIfscXoAgpGdc4WCZw&oe=67AEE7D6)

3. [Brain3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15239v3)

- [ ] Reproduce one of these
- [ ] Reproduce one of the 3D reconstruction papers

### Contest today 
Div2 1004 , Not good, messed up easy B and did C too late. But will keep iterating until established.

Tutorial + upsolve [here]()

### OSS 
Should look into Netflix / CrewAI / Ollama or C4GT.

### Everyday philosophy

People who don't commit to anything are distracted by everything.
