# Principles

1) SOLID 
   - Single Responsibility - This means that a class must have only one responsibility
   - Open/Closed - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
   - [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](https://blog.algomaster.io/i/142656403/l-liskov-substitution-principle-lsp) - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](https://blog.algomaster.io/i/142656403/i-interface-segregation-principle-isp) - No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
   - [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://blog.algomaster.io/i/142656403/d-dependency-inversion-principle-dip) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
  
2) [DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/082450d8-0e7b-4447-a8dc-b7308e45f048)
3) YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It
4) KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid
